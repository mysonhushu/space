      <td width="547" valign="top" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Forty-five minutes after taking off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, the plane returned to make an emergency landing. About 16-21nm west of Sheremetyevo Airport there was a thunderstorm. The aircraft was climbing through 7,900 feet when an electrical failure occurred, the flight control system degraded to "DIRECT MODE", the autopilot automatically disconnected; the aircraft was in the middle of thunderstorm activity. The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft until the end of the flight. The crew decided to return to Sheremetyevo and performed a manual ILS approach to runway 24L. At the time the aircraft intercepted the glideslope the aircraft’s mass was above the maximum landing weight. The crew deployed the flaps to 25 degrees in accordance with the flight crew operating manual for flight with minimum mode (DIRECT MODE) of the FCS as well as landing above MLW. At 15:26Z the crew set the emergency transponder code. Vapp was determined to be 155 KIAS, the descent on the glideslope was stabilised and without any deviation from Vapp. Descending between 1,100 and 900 feet the crew received 5 cycles of predictive windshear warnings. Descending through 260 feet AGL the aircraft began to deviate below the glide slope, a ‘GLIDESLOPE’ warning occurred. Descending between 180 to 40 feet the engine thrust was increased causing the aircraft to accelerate to 164 knots. At 16 feet AGL the speed was 170 KIAS. A Terrain Awareness Warning System aural signal ‘Retard’ occurred. The engine thrust was reduced to idle. At that point the captain began to apply oscillating pitch inputs with increasing amplitude which changed the pitch angle up to +6 and -2 degrees. The aircraft made a "three point" touchdown 900 meters past the runway threshold at 158 KIAS and a vertical load of +2.55G and bounced up to 6 feet AGL. The spoilers did not deploy. In DIRECT MODE they are not permitted to operate automatically and need to be extended manually, however the spoilers were not manually extended by the crew. Two seconds after the first touchdown the aircraft touched down a second time with the nose gear first at 155 KIAS and +5.85G. The aircraft bounced off again to 18 feet AGL. A third touchdown occurred at 140 KIAS in excess of +5G resulting in the destruction of the construction, a fuel spill and fire.</td>
