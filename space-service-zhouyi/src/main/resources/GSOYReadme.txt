GLOBAL SUMMARY OF THE YEAR (GSOY) DATA FILES
(Last Updated:  3/27/2017)

1.  INTRODUCTION

    1.1  OVERVIEW

         The Global Summary Of The Year (GSOY) Data Files contain quality controlled annual
         summaries of more than 50 elements (max temp, snow, etc.) computed from stations in
         the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)-Daily dataset.  These include non-US
         stations, providing a global product from 1763 to present that is updated weekly.
         This is not to be confused with GHCN-Monthly, which only contains temperature and
         precipitation elements and which include bias corrected data (which are not available
         in the first release of GSOM/GSOY).  Annual averages in the GSOY Data Files are computed
         from equally weighted months; (e.g, no weighting of months by number of days).  This is 
         to remain consistent with the National Data Stewardship Committee’s recommendation
         established in 2015.  Annual values are set to missing if one or more data-months during a
         data-year are missing.  A description of the files are included below in Section 1.3.

    1.2  ACCESS

         The GSOY Data Files can be accessed at the following location:

         https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/gsom/

    1.3  DOWNLOADING

         There are three sets of individual files that are included as part of the HPD Digital Inventory Reports:

         a.  XXY########.csv (GSOY Station Data File Name)

             XXY######## is the GHCN ID for the station in question, where:

             XX = FIPS Country Code Two-Letter Identifier
             Y = Station Network Code (Identifies The Station Numbering System Used)

                 Valid Station Network Codes:

                     0 = unspecified (station identified by up to eight 
	                 alphanumeric characters)
	             1 = Community Collaborative Rain, Hail,and Snow (CoCoRaHS)
	                 based identification number.  To ensure consistency with
	                 with GHCN Daily and GSOY, all numbers in the original CoCoRaHS
                         ID have been left-filled to make them all four digits long. 
	                 In addition, the characters "-" and "_" have been removed 
	                 to ensure that the IDs do not exceed 11 characters when 
	                 preceded by "US1". For example, the CoCoRaHS ID 
	                 "AZ-MR-156" becomes "US1AZMR0156" in GSOY
                     C = U.S. Cooperative Network identification number (last six 
                         characters of the GHCN ID)
	             E = Identification number used in the ECA&D non-blended
	                 dataset
	             M = World Meteorological Organization ID (last five
	                 characters of the GHCN ID)
	             N = Identification number used in data supplied by a 
	                 National Meteorological or Hydrological Center
	             R = U.S. Interagency Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS)
	                 identifier
	             S = U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service SNOwpack
	                 TELemtry (SNOTEL) station identifier
                     W = WBAN identification number (last five characters of the 
                         GHCN ID)

             ######### = Actual Station ID (Format Is Dependent on the Station Network Code)
             .csv = Comma-Delimited File Format Extension (can be opened in Excel, OpenOffice, etc.)

             For a complete list of stations and their Metadata, please see https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt .

             The following is the format of the data records that are contained within the GSOY Files (line spacing shown below between 
             element groups/attributes does NOT imply spacing within the GSOY Data Files):

                  "STATION" = GHCN ID (see above for further explanation)
                  "DATE" = YYYY-MM where YYYY is 4-digit year and MM is 2-digit month
                  "AWND" = Annual Average Wind Speed. Given in miles per hour or meters per second depending
                           on user specification.

                           end of the season. Each month is summed to produce a season-to-date total. Season starts in January
                           in Northern Hemisphere and July in Southern Hemisphere. Given in Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees depending on user
                           specification.

                  Celsius. (CDD = mean daily temperature - 65 degrees Fahrenheit/18.3 degrees Celsius). Each month is summed to produce an 
                  annual total. Annual totals are computed based on a January – December year in Northern Hemisphere and July – June
                  year in Southern Hemisphere). Given in Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees depending on user specification.
